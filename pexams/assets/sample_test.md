 * It is a secondary color formed by mixing blue and yellow, which is a common misconception in additive color theory where it is actually a primary color used in screens.
 * It is a primary color in the additive color system used by digital displays.
 * It is often associated with "success" or "go" actions in UI design.
 * It can be problematic for users with Deuteranopia if not paired with sufficient contrast.
